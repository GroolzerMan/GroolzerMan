- 👋 Hi, I’m @GroolzerMan
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (C# & python are my most experienced languages. I'd love to learn a bit of everything, though)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# informally on my own time. I am in the midst of making a website for myself, so I will learn java to add cool effects and stuff!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on N0thing atm. Though as of (21/03/2024) ive been planning a Terraria mod with my friend.
